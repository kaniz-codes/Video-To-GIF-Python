# Video-To-GIF-Python
 - this code uses the MoviePy library to load a video file, extract a specific segment (from 0 to 5 seconds), and save that segment as a GIF file named "test.gif." This is a simple way to cut a portion of a video and convert it into a GIF using Python.

- 𝐕𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐨𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐩("𝐤𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐳.𝐦𝐩𝟒") loads the video file "kaniz.mp4" and creates a VideoFileClip object representing the entire video.
.𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐜𝐥𝐢𝐩(𝟎, 𝟓) extracts a subclip from the original video, starting at 0 seconds and ending at 5 seconds. This creates a new VideoFileClip object representing the specified segment of the video.

- 𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐨.𝐰𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞_𝐠𝐢𝐟("𝐭𝐞𝐬𝐭.𝐠𝐢𝐟") converts the extracted video segment (subclip) into a GIF file named "test.gif." The .write_gif() method is used to create the GIF.
